extra space when used in documents, emails, etc. This script allows you 
to easily disable, and reenable, dropshadows as needed.

## Usage
To disable screenshot drop shadows, run the script in a terminal session 
and answer 'N' when prompted.

To enable screenshot drop shadows, run the script in a terminal session 
and answer 'Y' when prompted.
